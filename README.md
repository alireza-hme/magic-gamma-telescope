# MAGIC Gamma Telescope ML Project

This project applies various machine learning algorithms such as regression and classification on the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset from UC Irvine.

## Dataset

- **Name**: MAGIC Gamma Telescope
- **Source**: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
- **Description**: Data are MC generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model implementation.
- `models/`: Machine learning models and training scripts.
- `results/`: Outputs, metrics, and visualizations.

## Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Networks

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
